## Credits and Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank the following people and projects without whom this extension would never have existed:

* [Elia Argentieri](https://github.com/Elinvention) for [gnome-shell-extension-nasa-apod](https://github.com/Elinvention/gnome-shell-extension-nasa-apod)
which was a great inspiration for this extension, and has served me well for years.
* Each and every person involved in the heroic effort to bring modern Javascript, and in particular ES modules, to GNOME Shell, which cummulated in the awesome GNOME 45 release.
This made extension development so much more fun.
* [ts-for-gir](https://github.com/gjsify/ts-for-gir) which, together with ES modules, finally brings the power of Typescript to GNOME Shell extensions, without which Javascript has become unbearable for me.
* The people behind <https://gjs-docs.gnome.org/> which is a great API reference for Gjs and all the libraries in its ecosystem, in one place, with a powerful search.
* [Evan Welsh](https://gitlab.gnome.org/ewlsh/) for their amazing work on the magnificent <https://gjs.guide/> whose [extensions section](https://gjs.guide/extensions/) helps so much in getting things right, and finding your way around extension development.
* [Javad Rahmatzadeh](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrahmatzadeh), the author of [Just Perfection](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrahmatzadeh/just-perfection), for their tireless reviewing of my extensions, and carefully dissecting all the flaws therein;  an ungrateful work which is so absolutely essential to keep the extension system in good shape.
* All the people on the GNOME Extensions, GJS, and libadwaita Matrix channels, for patiently answering all my questions.
